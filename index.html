          <h2 align="center">Overview</h2>
          <p>The future of AI lies in enabling people to collaborate with machines to solve complex problems. Like any efficient collaboration, this requires good communication, trust, clarity and understanding. XAI (eXplainable AI) aims at addressing such challenges by combining the best of symbolic AI and traditional Machine Learning. Such topic has been studied for years by all different communities of AI, with different definitions, evaluation metrics, motivations and results. This tutorial is a snapshot on the work of XAI to date, and surveys the work achieved by the AI community with a focus on machine learning and symbolic AI related approaches.</p>

          <p>In the first part of the tutorial, we give an introduction to the different aspects of explanations in AI. We then focus the tutorial on two specific approaches: (i) XAI using machine learning and (ii) XAI using a combination of graph-based knowledge representation and machine learning. For both we get into the specifics of the approach, the state of the art and the research challenges for the next steps. The final part of the tutorial gives an overview of real-world applications of XAI.</p>

        <h2 align="center">Outline</h2>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Broad-spectrum introduction on explanation in AI. This will include describing and motivating the need for explainable AI techniques, from both theoretical and applicative standpoints. In this part we also summarize the prerequisites, and we introduce the different angles taken by the rest of the tutorial.</p>

        <h4>Explanation in AI</h4>
        <p>General overview of explanation in various field of AI (optimization, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, search and constraint optimization, planning, natural language processing, robotics and vision) to align everyone on the various definitions of explanation. The tutorial will cover most of definitions but will only go deep in the following areas: (i) Explainable Machine Learning, (ii) Explainable AI with Knowledge Graphs and ML.</p>

        <h4>Explainable Machine Learning.</h4>
        <p>In this section we tackle the broad problem of interpretable machine learning pipelines. We describe the notion of interpretability in the machine learning community, and we proceed by describing a number of popular interpretable models. The core of this section is the analysis of different categories of black box problems, ranging from the black box model explanation, to black box outcome explanation, and finally black box inspection.</p>

        <h4>Explainable AI with Knowledge Graphs and ML</h4>
        <p> In this section of the tutorial we address the explanatory power of graph-based knowledge bases from two separate points of views: </p>
        <div class="list-group">
          <ul>
            <li>
                <h5 class="list-group-item-heading">Explainable AI with semantic web and logics</h5>
                <p class="list-group-item-text">We show how the schema-rich, graph-based knowledge representation paradigm underpinning the semantic web enables effective explanations. This section also focuses on logics and reasoning methods for representing and inferring effective explanations from large, heterogeneous knowledge bases.
                </p>
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                <h5 class="list-group-item-heading">Machine learning on knowledge graphs</h5>
                <p class="list-group-item-text">In this section, we focus on knowledge graph embedding models, neural architectures that encode concepts from a knowledge graph into continuous, low-dimensional vectors. Such models have proven to be effective for a number of machine learning tasks, notably knowledge base completion. We explain the rationale and the architectures of this models and we survey them from the point of view of how nterpretable they are, and how they can enhance the explainability of third-party models.
                </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </div>

        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p>We show real-world examples of applied explanation techniques. We focus on a number of use cases: i) an interpretable flight delay prediction system, with built-in explanation capabilities; ii) a wide-scale contract management system that predicts and explains the risk tier of corporate projects with semantic reasoning over knowledge graphs; iii) an expenses system that identifies, explains, and predict abnormal expense claims by employees of large organizations in 500+ cities.</p>
